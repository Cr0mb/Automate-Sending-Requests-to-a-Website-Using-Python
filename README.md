# Automate-Sending-Requests-to-a-Website-Using-Python
This Python script automates the process of sending requests to a website using a list of proxies. It can be used to simulate views on a video or any other URL by cycling through various proxies and sending requests.

# Features
- Loads proxies from a file (proxies.txt)
- Sends requests to a specified video URL using different proxies
- Displays the status and response time for each request
- Utilizes random session durations for more realistic behavior
- Handles different types of proxies (http, https, socks4, socks5)

# Requirements
Python 3.x
```
pip install requests colorama
```

# Usage
1. Prepare Your Proxies

You can use this other script to get the proxies required for this project: [/Cr0mb/Proxy-Scraper](https://github.com/Cr0mb/Proxy-Scraper)

2. Change the URL

Change the URL to whatever site you want to send the requests to.
